        "Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, is the founder of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume.",
        "He was born on February 5, 1977, in Jiangsu, China, and later emigrated to Vancouver, Canada.",
        "CZ holds a degree in computer science from McGill University in Montreal, Canada.",
        "He previously worked at the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook, specializing in trading software.",
        "In 2005, he founded Fusion Systems in Shanghai, developing high-frequency trading systems for brokers.",
        "CZ entered the cryptocurrency industry in 2013, working with Blockchain.info and as Chief Technology Officer of OKCoin.",
        "In July 2017, he launched Binance, which quickly rose to dominate the global cryptocurrency exchange market.",
        "In November 2023, CZ stepped down as CEO of Binance after pleading guilty to money laundering-related charges in the United States.",
        "He was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 and released in September 2024.",
        "Post-release, CZ expressed plans to invest in blockchain, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, distancing himself from Binance.",
        "As of December 2024, his net worth is estimated at $66.7 billion, cementing his influence in the cryptocurrency industry."

    "lore": [
        "CZ sold his house in 2013 to buy Bitcoin, marking his full commitment to the cryptocurrency world, even before its mainstream popularity.",
        "CZ often positioned himself as a defender of the crypto community, advocating for financial freedom and accessibility to blockchain technology.",
        "He spearheaded initiatives like Binance Coin (BNB) and Binance Smart Chain, which remain integral parts of the blockchain ecosystem.",
        "After stepping down from Binance, CZ’s pivot toward “chilling” and focusing on personal investments adds an air of mystique to his post-Binance life."
